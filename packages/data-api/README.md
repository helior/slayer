# Slayer Data API

## Installation

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
```


### Development
Django uses a LOT of scaffolding scripts. And "chore" scripts. Ugh.

This one handles changes in the app models
```
python manage.py migrate
```

This one creates a new app
```
python manage.py startapp APP_NAME
```

Ths on installs a new app
```
python manage.ph makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```


## More about this code..
The original project scaffold was generated by this command:
```
django-admin startproject slayer
```
